# Government 3.0

Government 3.0 is building open source software for governments. 

## Why?

Many governments in the world do not have the resources to build proper government services for their citizens/residents. This means massive inefficiencies and slow, frustrating service for people that want to get things done. Things that can take seconds take days or weeks. Paper instead of computers. 

We believe we can build something better that governments can use to leap frog to the forefront of technology saving them a ton of taxpayer money and providing fast, efficient online services. 

Much of this relies on blockchain to ensure transparency and trust.
